# SAKSHAM — AICTE Approval Workflow & Compliance Management System
> **Tagline:** Intelligent Scrutiny. Automated Workflows. Transparent Compliance.  
> **Problem Statement ID:** Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 26262 — “Integrated AICTE Approval Workflow Automation, Compliance Monitoring and Alert Management System”  
> **Statutory Alignment:** AICTE Approval Process Handbook (APH) 2024–25 to 2026–27  
> **Phase:** Phase 1 — Project Foundation & Government-Grade Administrative Portal Shell  

---

## 1. Project Overview & Scope
**SAKSHAM** is a role-based workflow automation and compliance management platform designed from the perspective of AICTE officials, regional officers, and expert committee members who process technical institution approval queues.

### Key Capabilities in Phase 1:
- **Government-Grade Administrative Shell:** Deep navy blue palette (`#0A1B38`), crisp typography, accessible high-contrast tables, and restrained saffron/green indicators.
- **Ten Core Navigable Routes:**
  - `/login`: Formal administrative sign-in with development role persona simulator.
  - `/dashboard`: Unified executive dashboard with mathematically synchronized metrics.
  - `/applications`: Searchable, multi-parameter filterable master application register.
  - `/workflow-queue`: Scrutiny & Re-Scrutiny SLA queues with ageing indicators (>7d breach alerts).
  - `/evc`: Expert Visit Committee inspection tracker and 48-hour report submission countdown.
  - `/compliance`: Time-bound institutional undertakings and 30/60/90-day conditional approvals.
  - `/document-validity`: Land lease tenure (&ge;30y), Fire Safety NOC, and NBA accreditation expiry monitoring.
  - `/reports`: Operational reporting and regional workload distribution charts (Recharts).
  - `/audit`: Forensic, tamper-evident audit trail capturing every officer decision and stage transition.
  - `/admin/rules`: Versioned regulatory rules engine citing specific APH chapters and clauses.
- **Cardinal Regulatory Principle:** SAKSHAM supports authorized human scrutiny, inspection, and verification. **It does NOT and shall NEVER autonomously grant regulatory approval.**
- **Transparent Boundaries:** Uses a coherent, deterministic synthetic dataset. Fully isolated from restricted live AICTE systems.
